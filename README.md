# FWD - CSS Battle
Clone this repo into htdocs (or similar) and it should work when accessed via localhost URL.

You can delete the data in scores.json and start with an empty array to start fresh.

It updates scores when a new one is submitted and also checks every 10 seconds for new scores. (The checking is probably unnecessary unless we are editing the scores.json file manually but helpful for testing.)

The leaderboard is output based on highest score to lowest score.
